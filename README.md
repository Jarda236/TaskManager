## This project is just simple Task Manager
This project is my learning .NET MVC web application, where I aim to follow conventions, simplicity, and readability. Over time, I plan to implement some interesting business logic related to tasks or any other ideas that come to mind.

### Functions
- users using default setup of Identity framework
- add/delete/edit and complete tasks
- user categories
- basic statistics
